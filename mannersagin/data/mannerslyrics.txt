so now we see
comes burying my burnt remains
these puddled clouds
oh i i understand now
but darkness falls likes shattered pieces
dangling shimmering
torn and tattered and crowned
oh i'll not be told no to no more
you must believe to hear me sing these
messy morsels of my self-assuring love
oh it's painful kneading
yes i lie and i wrangle with prospective angles
that glare me down and face me
with all i do wrong
why do they all look like me
so i try and i scream and i beg and i sigh
just to prove i'm alive and it's alright
cause tonight there's a way i'll make light
of my treacherous life
if i had hands i'd hold up high
my lofty dreams and my alibi's real name
but i have no strength
so i toss and i turn and i spit in the urn
there's a ghost in your eye
there is someone that knows more than i
but i'm quick to deny
when i came down the dawn poured into me
i shook em up the walls came crumbling
my fists kept trembling with these salty wounds
my stolen gold inside the emperors tomb
now painting rainbows on my ugly face
i built this cardboard neighborhoods disgrace
but i ascend and serve my feverish need
within the confines of such chemistry
it's the way i see
everything i need
it's no way to be
let this be our little secret
no one needs to know were feeling
higher and higher and higher
higher and higher and higher
but i feel alive and i feel it in me
up and up i keep on climbing
higher and higher and higher
higher and higher and higher
my face blew up at such a casual sight
the smattered colors of ecstatic fright
the rush above me to oblivion
outlining wet sidewalks in halogen
oh have you ever felt so goddamn strong
how come it takes some people so damn long
he tried to squeeze the lemon juice to rain
the citrus drawing out the scene in stains
watch the basin drain
as your life lines wane
and you can't explain
as your friends complain
you've caused all this pain
and you proudly shame
your whole family's name
mother i can tell what you've been thinking
staring at the stars on your ceiling
thinking once there was a power that you were wielding
and now i've hit the mark
stabbing at the dark
and i cannot help but ignore the people staring at my scars
dear friend as you know
your flowers are withering
your mother's gone insane
your leaves have drifted away
but the clouds are clearing up
and i've come reveling
burning incandescently
like a bastard on the burning sea
you're just like your father
buried deep under the water
you're resting on your laurels
and stepping on my toes
whose side are you on
what side is this anyway
put down your sword and crown
come lay with me on the ground
you come beating like moth's wings
spastic and violently
whipping me into a storm
shaking me down to the core
but you run away from me
and you left me shimmering
like diamond wedding rings
spinning dizzily down on the floor
we dug these holes we crawled into
now they're my home
now here i cannot feel the wind
can't feel the rain or cold
and i believe in gentle harmony
how i loathe all this obscenity
is the way my life's got to be
by a single opportunity
look at me oh look at me
is this the way i've always been oh no oh no
now i'm dreaming somebody
would simply come and kidnap me oh no oh no
everyday i lie awake and pray to god
today's the day oh no oh no
here i am here i am
when will someone understand oh no oh no
and all at once i feel this
oh how it clings to me
it reels and calls me towards it
confounding destiny
and i can feel the madness inch by inch
the more i run the more i am convinced
iâ€™ve colored all these like the branches twist
just like we settle in the foggy mist
my world is stirring sickly
spits out our voices singing
sha la la la oh no no
to kingdom come so slightly
here in the void in your place
i twitch and tweak an illusion
to sit and stare so blankly
until our hope is used up
why do i always seem to need you when you're fleeing
where do you go when i'm around
what have i done what have i lost that's so defeating
and have the nerve to wear a crown
oh
na na na na na na hey hey hey
some unguarded room
a smoky figure fills me full
makes my head swell and ruin
my family kneels at the pew
they nod  'we believe in what you're doing'
i feel you rise above me
the western landscape's towering
and from my shell of a body
the flowers blossom for picking
i've waited and waited for someone to take it
don't fight it don't bother an inch for another
don't listen don't hear them they're in this together
i've learned well now hear me there's much to be fearing
i'm used to your absence your faceless distraction
i've painted your patterns but found them attractive
now i've been leaning towards a life far more candid
though lead through the dark with your eyes as my candles
where your life and my life's directions can wrangle
and all of a sudden you've left me to handle
the reasons that never forbid me to stand tall
and somehow oh somehow i'll find out the secret
to staying alive without actually breathing
my eyes have once again been proven wrong
your clouds your blanket and my pity song
hovering on your front lawn
carry on until it's gone
what can i do
the river's overrun
we're swimming in a flood you know
i thought i felt your touch
but the water's rising up
then i lie naked in a rampage
in the flesh face to face with the onset
i forget everything that's ever made me
rise again
now slowly leave my memory
leave me alone
leave me alone
leave me alone
i'm fine
i'll be fine until the morning comes
then unmask me in the blistering sun
oh let me go
just let me go
just let me go
or i'll burst in front of your eyes
then collect myself from the ground
and when i go
and when i go
just let me go
like a light
flickering out in the skies
lost as fast as was found
everything's easy when you never have to choose
with the balances shifting it refers to you
like the sun and the moon i will circle you til you bloom
i will crush our love let it burn until i get to you
lay low
don't let me know what is real
we'll be quietly following you
will they take me as their own
now i will hold you i will keep you up and show my love
until it folds in my hands
but ill build it back to the top
feel it rain
feel it rain
we're alive
feel it rain
that's a frosty way to speak
to tell me how to live next to your potpourri
all this talking pulls my teeth
i believed in you so you'd believe in
me i cried out god
you dared me in the dark
i felt a hush fall quietly from my spark
so now i hide in piles
of princely orange peels
it feels the way you told me
how it'd always feel

once i had a name to claim
i scraped on all the walls
like an orthodox saint
i wish for the same old things
that turned me inside out
keeling in such pain
it's all a game
never have i ever been
clutching at your hair
to cure you of some sin
but that's the kind of state i'm in
swimming in a pool of godly medicine
come come hear it calling me yelling like
if ever there was someone who could make things
heavenly again
feel alright
in pastures blue and green
i'll follow you and you'll follow me
my fabrics mystery
i'll wave your loyalty in the freezing
breeze so desperately
and another one comes down
and another one comes down
and another one comes down
i think i see my life
he bows all slyly and gentle like
he's never had the right
i've never lived without
his sad and jealous eyes
and another one comes down
and another one comes down
and another one comes down
they'd say
let your love grow tall
let your love grow tall
tall as the grass in the meadow
or the dunes on the shore
like the buildings in the city
and your children on the floor
like the darkness in the forest
like my frightened worried eyes
or the roots in the soil
are skies telling lies
but it's the thought that counts
quiet minds don't know their worth
they know what to do
so i'll pray for them and i'll pray for you
till my face turns blue
some day you'll see
surrounded by angels
floating atop of the sea
abandon me
don't go where they go
don't sing all the songs they sing
nobody knows you
the way you know you
but i think i do
but i thought i knew
yeah i thought i knew
nobody knows you
the way you know you
but i think i do
but i thought i knew
yeah i thought i knew
between these walls
her back strange glimpse
casts shadows frighteningly tall
i slow to a crawl
i jump and i yell
but she hears nothing at all
stay stay the same
cause everything else will change
and i've always been to blame
so please just stay the same
the currents pull me in
the tide has reached my chin
the seaweed tickles skin
just let the water win
i'm freezing to the bone
you'll never be at home
just watch you're running out
just watch your body go
